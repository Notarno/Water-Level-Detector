# Water-Level-Detector
Implementation of a Water Level Detector system for industrial or residential use

# Design:
- Detector can detect 4 water levels ranging from 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and 4/4
- Detector controls the inflow of water based on the volume left in the container
    - When the container is 1/4 full, water pump will flow at a faster rate
    - When the container is 3/4 full, water pump will flow at a slower rate
    
# Hardware and Software used:
- Programmed in Assembly Language using the HC12 Microprocessor
- Used built in Motor to simulate water pump and LCD screen to display water levels
- Used buttons to set the water levels and control the motor
